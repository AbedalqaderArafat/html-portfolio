<h1>The Best Movies According to AQ</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Animes of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Bleach</h3>

<p>This show has been a major part of my childhood,
     I have rewatched it 3 times and was ecstatic when 
     it was continued.</p>

<h3>2.Katekyoshi Hitman Reborn</h3>

<p>My sister introduced me to this show, 
    it is 200 episodes long and I have watched 
    it 5 times excluding the filler. It starts 
    off slow but is great overall

<h3>3.One piece</h3>
<p>
    Amazing
